# Ecommerce Front-end Design Brief
## Brief
I am new to e-commerce! I have been selling my products mostly through trade shows and trade festivals. I am getting a little older and do not have the energy to travel around the country selling my stuff...

I have heard that you are the right person to come to, to design a website.

I am looking for a site where the customer is directed to my main product category straight-away. The main product category is hand-bags, although this can change due to seasonality.

I would also like potential customers to see all product categories that I sell, such as: hand-bags, jewelry; antique chairs; sculptures; and tie-dye T-shirts.

Each product category has approximately 10 products in it, but I do plan on expanding into more products within the categories...

Historically, people who haven't bought the product at the trade show have simply called me up after trade shows and ordered over the phone, I am quite comfortable with this.

I am not looking to get rich, I just want to continue doing what I love!
