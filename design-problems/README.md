# Purpose
This section is used to test your ability to conceptualise a brief given to you in the form of a short paragraph of text. When working for companies project owners / managers, clients, customers, etc. offer briefs in many forms, however the most common is in the form of a few paragraphs of text or bullet points. I would recommend that you ask questions before proceeding with a brief when you dive into a project as brief writers can sometimes verbalise problems in ways that may not be inline with how you think. For the purposes of this folder I have attempted to include mock-ups as a pure guideline / aid to the brief, however it is important for you to create your own mock-ups as this is the design portion of an interview.
