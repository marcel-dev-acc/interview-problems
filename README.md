# Interview Problems
Included in this repository are past interview problems I have had to solve, 
interview problems which have been given to me by other coders and, lastly, 
interview problems which I have found quite interesting.

## Purpose:
The purpose of this repository is to get you prepared for interviews, make you feel comfortable 
answering abstract coding problems and just generally to have some fun.
